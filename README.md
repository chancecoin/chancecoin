## Description

Chancecoin (CHA) is a protocol, coin, and client used to bet on dice rolls in a decentralized casino.

## How do I buy CHA?

During the burn period, you can burn BTC into CHA using the standard Chancecoin wallet or command line interface. You can also burn BTC into CHA by sending BTC to 1ChancecoinXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXZELUFD using a Bitcoin client or Blockchain.info. After the burn period, you can still trade CHA for BTC on the decentralized exchange using the standard Chancecoin wallet or command line interface.

### Burning with the Chancecoin wallet

Open the wallet software and click on "Wallet." Under the "Burn" section, fill in your address and desired quantity to burn. Then click "Burn."

### Burning with the command line interface

Run "python chancecoind.py burn --source SOURCE --quantity QUANTITY"

### Burning with a Bitcoin client

To burn with a Bitcoin client, simply send the amount of BTC you want to burn to 1ChancecoinXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXZELUFD. As long as one of the outputs is 1ChancecoinXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXZELUFD, the burn will be credited to the first input address.

### Burning with Blockchain.info

To burn using a Blockchain.info wallet, do the following:

  1. Log in to your wallet.
  2. Click "Send Money."
  3. Choose "Quick Send" under "Transaction Type."
  5. Enter 1ChancecoinXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXZELUFD for the "To" address.
  6. Enter the amount of BTC you want to burn.
  9. Click "Send Payment."

Note that when you use multiple input addresses, the CHA is credited to the first input address.

## How do I gamble?

You can gamble using the standard Chancecoin wallet or command line interface.

### Gambling with the Chancecoin wallet

Open the wallet software and click on "Casino." Choose the amount of CHA you want to bet, and the desired payout or odds of winning (one will determine the other). Then click "Roll the Dice."

### Gambling with the command line interface

Run "python chancecoind.py bet --source SOURCE --bet BET --chance CHANCE --payout PAYOUT." Note that the chance of winning and the payout must be congruent. This is best illustrated with an example: if the chance of winning is 50 (meaning 50%), then the payout is 1/0.5*(1-0.02)=1.96, where 0.02 is the house edge.

## How do I bankroll the house?

By owning CHA, you are automatically bankrolling the house. On average, you can expect to earn the house edge of 2.0% per bet.
