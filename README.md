## Description

Chancecoin is a protocol and coin (CHA) used to bet on dice rolls in a decentralized casino. Owners of the coin may gamble on dice rolls, with randomness provided by Bitcoin block hashes. Owners of the coin are automatically invested in the house bankroll. The protocol, which is based on Counterparty (XCP), is built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Coins are created by burning Bitcoins.
