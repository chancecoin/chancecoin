chancecoind
==================================================

Chancecoin is a protocol for the creation and use of decentralised financial instruments such as asset
exchanges, contracts for difference and dividend payments. It uses Bitcoin as a transport layer.
The Chancecoin protocol specification may be found `here <https://github.com/PhantomPhreak/Chancecoin>`__.

``chancecoind`` is the reference client (and server daemon) implementation of the Chancecoin protocol.

To get ``chancecoind`` installed and set up on your computer, you have two options:

- Set it up manually, using the instructions `here <https://github.com/PhantomPhreak/chancecoind/blob/master/README.md>`__
- For Windows and Ubuntu Linux users, you can use the `automated build system <http://chancecoind-build.rtfd.org>`__
